Title: Simultaneous Generation and Improvement: A Unified RL Paradigm for FJSP Optimization

Summary: 
This paper presents an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework targeting the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). The approach consists of a generative model that constructs solutions and an improvement model that refines them, both trained concurrently using graph neural networks to represent instances. The framework aims for scalability and generalizability, asserting superior performance on larger problem instances even with training on smaller ones. The empirical results suggest improvements over traditional heuristics, meta-heuristics, and prior deep reinforcement learning approaches.

Strengths:
1. **Novel Framework**: The combination of a generative model and a separate improvement model working concurrently through reinforcement learning and graph neural networks is an innovative architecture for FJSP.
2. **Use of GNNs**: Employing graph neural networks to encode FJSP leverages their ability to handle the graph-like structure of scheduling problems, potentially enhancing scalability and solution quality.
3. **Generalization**: The framework claims strong generalization, showing performance robustness across different problem scales, a critical aspect for practical application in diverse industrial settings.
4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation on both synthetic and public benchmark datasets with comparisons to PDRs, meta-heuristics, and DRL-based methods provides a multi-faceted analysis of the approach's efficacy.

Weaknesses:
1. **Clarity and Detail**: The paper lacks detailed explanations of specific implementation choices, such as the precise neural network architectures and hyperparameter selection, which are crucial for reproducibility.
2. **Fair Comparison**: Although the paper compares against various baselines, it does not detail whether these baselines are the best state-of-the-art versions. Additionally, comparisons might not account for variances in computational resources and time constraints.
3. **Significance Testing**: Statistical tests to validate the empirical improvements over baselines are either missing or not clearly reported, raising questions about the robustness of the claims.
4. **Generality of Claims**: While the method demonstrates promising results, it may lack assessment in real-world constraints or scenarios, limiting the scope of its application.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Expand the paper to include a section on the architectural choices made for the neural networks, including hyperparameter values and tuning strategies.
2. Ensure that the comparisons with baseline methods are fair and illustrative of the best possible performance of those methods, potentially detailing any tuning performed for baselines.
3. Incorporate statistical significance tests to bolster claims of performance improvements.
4. Explore additional evaluations or discussions considering real-world application scenarios and constraints where the proposed framework might be applied.

Overall Recommendation: Borderline

While the paper presents an intriguing new approach and reports promising results, the lack of clarity in certain methodological details and the need for more robust statistical validation temper its overall impact. Further revisions and enhancements in these areas could merit a stronger recommendation.
