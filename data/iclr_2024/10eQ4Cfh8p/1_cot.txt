ABSTRACT
We present an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed to address
the Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP). Our approach consists of two primary
components: a generative model that produces problem solutions stepwise, and a
secondary model that continually refines these (partial) solutions. Importantly, we
train both models concurrently, enabling each to be cognizant of the other’s pol-
icy and make informed decisions. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that
our model delivers better performance in shorter time on several public datasets
comparing to baseline algorithms. Furthermore, we highlight the superior gen-
eralizability of our approach, as it maintains strong performance on large-scale
instances even when trained on small-scale instances. It is worth noting that
this training paradigm can be readily adapted to other combinatorial optimization
problems, such as the traveling salesman problem and beyond.
1 I NTRODUCTION
In the field of industrial manufacturing, the scheduling of manufactured demands and manufacturing
resources is an extremely important task. The task requires the scheduling system to provide an
optimal scheduling solution as much as possible so that all manufactured demands can be completed
in the shortest time on the processing machine. Cloud manufacturing that has developed in recent
years, due to the open environment of the cloud foundation, these scheduling problems will become
larger in scale, more diversified and more dynamic. These changes have put higher demands on the
real-time and versatility of the scheduling system.
This paper mainly studies a well-known NP-hard problem —- Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Prob-
lem which is famous in the field of cloud manufacturing. FJSP is an extension of a well-known
combinatorial optimization problem which is Job Shop Schdule Problem(JSSP). Unlike the oper-
ations in the JSP problem that can be processed on any machine, the operations in FJSP are only
allowed to be processed on their respective machine sets. This peculiarity makes FJSP not only
need to consider the processing order of operations, but also need to consider assigning suitable
processing machines for operations. These factors make FJSP more complex and diversified.
Due to the complexity of the FJSP problem, exact solution methods such as mathematical program-
ming and constraint programming require a lot of computational time. The computational time
will become unbearable when the instance size is too large. Therefore, some approximate solution
methods that reduce solution quality in exchange for solution time have been proposed.
Priority dispatching rule(PDR) is a well-known heuristic method [4] that schedules operations to
suitable machines for processing by designing a series of priority rules, such as algorithms based on
FIFO(first in first out) and SPT(shortest processing time).
Meta-heuristic methods represented by genetic algorithms [7; 8; 9; 10] have also received much
attention. Compared with PRD heuristic methods, these methods can get higher quality solutions
but also require more time.
With the increasing attention paid to deep learning and reinforcement learning in the field of com-
binatorial optimization in recent years, some related methods [28; 29] have also been used to solve
FJSP problems. The method based on deep reinforcement learning will establish an MDP model
for the FJSP problem and then train a parameterized policy model in this MDP model through a
1Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
human-designed reward function. Finally, use the trained policy model to solve the FJSP problem.
Compared with traditional methods, these reinforcement learning-based methods have shown great
potential in terms of computational time and solution quality.
In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end framework based on graph neural networks and deep
reinforcement learning for solving FJSP problems. Our framework consists of two models: one
is a generation model used to generate scheduling solutions for unassigned operations; the other
is an improving model used to improve current assigned operations scheduling solutions. When
solving, these two models will make decisions alternately. The generation model generates a partial
solution, and then the improvement model improves this partial solution to output an improved
partial solution. Then the generation model will continue to generate more complete partial solutions
based on the improved solution of the previous round until all workpieces are completed assigned,
and finally the optimal solution output by the improvement model for the last time will be used as
the final solution.
Due to our framework using graph neural networks to extract features from FJSP instance, there
is no limit to the scale size of input instances for our model. This peculiarity allows our model to
solve instances of different scales rather than just training set scales. This allows us to train our
model on small-scale instances data set and then use it to solve larger-scale problem. This powerful
generalization ability allows our model to have a wider range of application scenarios.
We conducted comparative experiments on public datasets and randomly generated datasets to verify
that our proposed method has more advantages in terms of solving time and efficiency compared
with other methods. Not only that, we also conducted a series of ablation experiments to study the
impact of each module in our proposed framework on experimental results. In summary, this article
makes the following main contributions:
• Proposed an end-to-end framework based on graph neural networks and deep reinforcement
learning for solving FJSP problems.
• Designed a novel joint training method for training our proposed framework.
• Conducted a series of ablation experiments to study each module in our proposed frame-
work.
2 B ACKGROUND
Flexible Job Shop Schedule Problem A FJSP instance of size n×mincludes njobs and m
machine. Using Jto represent the set of job and Mto represent the set of machine. For each
jobJi∈ J has an operation set Oi,which contains nioperations, Oijmeans the operation with
processing order jof the JiinJ. Each operation Oijcan be processed on any machine Mkfrom
its compatible set Mij∈ M for a processing time pijkwhen the machine is in idle state.To obtain
a solution for FJSP,each operation Oijshould be assigned a machine and start processing time Sij
to process. A FJSP instance can be described as a disjunctive graph G= (O,C,D). Specifically
O={Oij|∀i, j} ∪ {start, end }is the node set,which includes all operation and two dummy nodes
means start and end of production.These two node can be processed by any machine with zero
processing time. Cis the set of conjunctive arcs,which are directed arcs that form npaths from Start
toEnd representing the repective processing sequence of Ji.D=∪kDkis the set of disjunctive
arcs which are undirected,and Dkis a set of arcs which connects the operations that can be processed
on machine Mk. Solving FJSP is equivalent to selecting a disjunction arc and fixing its direction for
each operation node. In order to more clearly represent the belonging relationship of each operation
to the machine in the solution, we separate these directional displacement arcs from the disciple
graph to form a solution graph, which will be used to serve our framework for solution generation
and improvement. A FJSP instance and one of its feasible solution can be described by Fig 1.
Conventional Method for FJSP Coneventional methods for solving the FJSP problem can be
roughly divided into three categories: exact methods, heuristic methods, and meta-heuristic meth-
ods.Exact methods usually combine integer linear programming [3] and constraint programming
[4]. These methods can guarantee the optimality of the solution through rigorous mathematical rea-
soning, but they require a lot of computational time. Therefore, exact methods can only be used to
solve small-scale problems. Heuristic methods design optimization algorithms by introducing expert
prior knowledge. Compared to exact methods, heuristic methods require very short computational

solution.
time, but at the same time, they also reduce the quality of the solution. Typical heuristic methods
for solving the FJSP problem include PDR [5], A* [6], local search [7], etc. More Specially, the
methods based on PDR are widely used in production systems in real world due to its easy imple-
mentation and less computation time. Meta-heuristics can be further classified into single solution
based(e.g. simulated annealing [8], tabu search [9] and population-based (e.g. genetic algorithm
[10; 11]) methods, which works on a single solution or a population of solutions. Complete reviews
of FJSP methods can be found in [1; 2].
DRL base method for FJSP Recently,more and more work is using DRL to solve complex
scheduling problems. The key issues when using DRL are how to extract features from the FJSP
and how to formulate the problem as an MDP. Some research use multilayer perceptron (MLP)
[12; 13; 14; 15] or convolution neural network (CNN) [16] to extract features from FJSP instance
to represent the state as a feature vector. It is obvious that these methods have a significant dis-
advantage that the network structure will limit the size of the input problem, which means that a
trained model can only solve FJSP instances of the same size. Some methods based on recurrent
neural network(RNN) [32]and attention mechanism [18] are proposed to solve the problem of dif-
ferent input sizes. Obviously, compared with the above-mentioned network structures, GNN [20]
has a natural advantage in dealing with FJSP problems represented by graphs. [21] propose methods
which combine DRL and GNN to learn PDRs for JSP. [23] uses DQN to solve FJSP by selecting
the best one from a pool of hand-crafted PDRs with policy model. [24] propose an DRL method
without considering the graph structure which makes it lose a lot of useful information for decision
making. [29; 30] propose an end-to-end DRL method combines GNN respectively,which generate
solutions of FJSP by assigning operations step-by-step using a policy model.We will compare our
method with the methods of these two papers in the experimental section.
3 G ENERALIZATION -IMPROVING MODEL
We use a Graph S= (O,E,C)to represent the solution of FJSP (in figure). It should be noted each
arcE∈ Econnects two sequentially adjacent operations that are processed on the same machine and
Each arc C∈ Cconnects the operation on the same job,which both of these two arc set are directed.
There are at most mforward paths from start to end in S(mis the number of machines) which are
connected by arc in E, and each path represents the operation processing queue of a machine. More
specifily, if Oijis located on path kwith position l, it means Oijhas been assigned to Mkwith order
lto process. We use makespan Cmax to measure the quality of a solution S, which is equal to the
processing completion time of the last operation to be completed among all operations.
To solve FJSP, we need to generate Sthat makes all operation connect with directed arcs E∈ E.
We consider the process of generating Sas a sequential decision-making task. Our method uses a
generative model and an improvement model to alternate decision-making to produce a solution. At
the begining of the round, we initialize a partial solution S0thatE=∅. Then we use the generation
model to assign a machine to an unassigned operation. At this point, the edge set EofS0add new
corresponding edge,which form the next partial solution ˆS1. Afterwards, the improvement model
3Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
will adjust the position of certain operation nodes(equivalent to changing the connections of edges
in the edge set EinˆS1) according to the policy to obtain a higher quality solution S1. The generation
model and improvement model will continue to cycle through this process until all operations have
been assigned. Fig 2 demonstrates the interaction process between the two models and the solution
at a time step. In the following sections, we will further elaborate on the model structure and
decision-making process of these two models.
Figure 2: An overview of our framework. In a time step, the Generate Model assigns an unprocessed
operation to a machine for processing and updates the solution, after which the Improve Model
modifies the solution rtimes by reinserting the processed operation.
3.1 MDP F ORMULATION FOR FJSP
State For both generate and improve step, the observation is a Graph of FJSP instance. The GAT
module gets Node feature vectors from Operation Node’s raw feature (Definition in section3.2) and
adjacency matrix. The State vector equals avenger pooling value for all Node feature vectors which
is difined as Eq.5.
Action For generate step, the action’s target is choosing which operation-machine pair as the next
schedule. For each step, the action space size is equal to Nj×Nm(Njmeans number of jobs, Nm
means number of machine) because of the job order constraints. Different with generate, improve
action will select an operation and insert it into the new position. More details on defining action
vectors are presented in section 3.2.
Transition A solution graph is maintained in a whole of schedule. Solution Graph consists of two
parts: operation node raw feature and adjacency matrix. For generate step, when an action has been
executed, a new edge between two different operation nodes will be added to the solution graph.
However, for the improve step, we first need to remove the edge connected to the selected operation,
and then add the corresponding edge at the insertion position.
Reward For generate step, The reward function is simply equal to the difference in Cmax when
the solution is updated. However, for the improve step. The reward for each time step consists of
two parts: Step reward which can be calculated immediately at each time step which is as same
as generate step, and global reward which can only be calculated uniformly after the enrie rtimes
improve step is finshed. It is equal to the Cmax difference between the solution before the first
improve step and the solution after the last improve step divided by the number of improve steps r.
3.2 M ODEL STRUCTURE
Operation Orignal Feature Vector: Taking an operation node Oijas an example, its original
features consist of seven elements. These include the assignment flag value fij, average processing

ij, processing time tp
ij, processing end time te
ij, percentile in its job

oJ
ij, and percentile in its machine processing queue oM
ij. More specifically, the assignment flag value
fijequal to 0when the operation node is not assigned to any machine for processing, otherwise
it equal to 1. The average processing time is equal to the average processing time of all machines
that can process the operation. The processing start time is equal to the maximum processing end
time of all predecessor nodes of the operation in graph S. The processing time is equal to the
average processing time if the operation is not assigned, otherwise it is equal to the processing time
required by the machine that processes the node. The processing end time is equal to the sum of the
processing start time and the processing time. The job sequence is equal to the rank of the operation
in its job divided by the number of operations in the job. The machine sequence is equal to the
rank of the operation in its machine processing queue divided by the number of operations in the
processing queue. hence,The original feature vector uijof operation node Oijcan be expressed as:
uij= [fij, ta
ij, ts
ij, tp
ij, te
ij, oJ
ij, oM
ij]
GAT Module (GM): GAT [26] is a network structure for processing graph feature extraction,
which generates the features of a node by aggregating all its neighboring nodes. A GAT network
layer takes the original feature vectors of the nodes and the adjacency matrix of a graph as input
and outputs an aggregated feature vector for each node. In S= (O,E,C),we use NJ
ijto represent
the neighbor nodes of Oijon the edge set C,NM
ijto represent the neighbor nodes on E, and uijto
represent the feature vector of Oij. GAT first computes the attention coefficient between uijand
each node ukin{NJ
ij∪ NM
ij}(including uijitself) as:
eijk=LeakyReLU (aT[Wuij||Wuk]) (1)
Then the coefficients are normalized across the neighborhood using sofmax function:
αijk=softmax (eijk)
Finally,GAT aggregates features and apply a avitation function to get output:
u′
ij=σ(X
k∈{NJ
ij∪NM
ij}αijkWuk) (2)
It is worth noting that the output of a GAT network layer is also a feature vector. As a result, we
can stack multiple GAT layers to form a Gm to obtain more powerful feature extraction capabilities
when the adjacency matrix is square. More specifically,the calculation process of the layer iinGm
can be represented as:
U(i)=GAT(i)(U(i−1), A)
Operation Node Embedding: We use a module GmOconsisting of LOlayers of GAT stacking
to obtain the embedding vector of the operation node. The GmOtakes the original feature matrix
of all operation nodes Uand an adjacency matrix AOwhich constructed from all edges in Eand
Cas input.The embedding vector of operation node can be calculated as( dis a hyperparameter
representing the embedding dimension which the same as following):
EO=GmO(U, A O), EO∈R|O|×d(3)
Insert Position Embedding: We define the insertion position as the blank space between two
adjacent operations (including start and end nodes) in the same machine processing queue. Based
on this definition, for an operation in an n×mscale FJSP instance, there will be at most n+m
different insertion positions, so the total number of insertion positions is equal to nI=n×(n+m).
In order to use GAT to extract the features of these insertion positions, we define an adjacency matrix
AIrepresenting the insertion position with dimensions of nI×n. In the matrix, element Mij= 1
when operation Ojis adjacent to insertion position i, otherwise Mij= 0.Then, we input the original
feature matrix of the operation UandAJintoGmIcomposed of a single GAT layer (since AJis
not a square matrix, the GAT layers cannot be stacked), and we can output the embedding vector of
all insertion position EI.The embedding vector of insert position can be calculated as:
EI=GmI(U, A I), EI∈RnI×d
Machine Process Queue Embedding: The embedding of the machine-processed queue is
achieved through a single GAT layer due to its use of a non-square adjacency matrix for input.We
5Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
use the original features Uof the operation nodes and the adjacency matrix AMrepresenting the
subordinate relationship between the operation nodes and the machine as input. AMis a|M| × |O|
(|M| is the number of machines, |O|is number of operations).For each element Mijof this matrix,
ifOjis processed on Machine i, then Mij= 1, otherwise it is equal to 0.The embedding vector of
machine process queue can be calculated as:
EM=GmM(U, A M), EM∈R|M|× d
Job Sequence Embedding: Similar to the embedding of the machine processing queue, the job
sequence embedding is also achieved by a single GAT layer. It takes the original feature matrix of
the operation and the adjacency matrix AJrepresenting the subordinate relationship between the
operation nodes and the job as input. AJis a|J | × |O| (|J |is the number of jobs, |O|is num-
ber of operations).The assignment of elements is similar to that of the machine process queue.The
embedding vector of job sequence node can be calculated as:
EJ=GmJ(U, A J), EJ∈R|J|×d
Policy Model: Our framework makes decisions based on the DuelingDQN algorithm, which esti-
mates the advantage value of state-action pairs to make decisions. More specifically, the algorithm
calculates the advantage values of all feasible actions a∈Atunder state stat step tand selects the
action a∗
tcorresponding to the maximum advantage value,as:
a∗
t=argmax a∈AtA(st, a) (4)
For both generative model and improvement model, sObtained by average pooling of all operation
node embedding vectors output by GmO,as:
s=meanpooling (EO) (5)
The action of the generated model is formed by concatenating the job embedding, the machine
processing queue embedding and the operation embedding vector. More specifically, an generative
action vector:
aG= [Ei
J, Ej(i)
O, Ek
M] (6)
represents that the first unassigned operation Oj(i)in the job Jiis inserted into the end of processing
queue for machine Mk. Hence, at most |J |×|M| actions need to be considered for each generative
decision. For improvement model, an action consists of operation embeddings and an insertion
position embeddings.An improved action vector
aI= [Ei
O, Ej
I] (7)
means to move operation Oito insertion position j. Obviously, there are at most m different insertion
schemes for each improvement decision. Both the generative model and the improvement model will
use formula(4) to select the action to be executed in the current state stat step ton their respective
feasible action sets.The advantage value function is fitted by a parametric MLP.
4 A LGORITHM AND TRAINING
In order to train the parameters in our framework, we propose a joint training method based on
DuelingDQN algorithm [27]. We consider a complete episode as the process of the generative
model and improvement model interacting with the FJSP environment. At each step, the generative
model makes decision based on the previous solution and outputs action. The agent takes this action
to interact with the environment and transitions to the next state to generate a new solution. Then, the
improvement model outputs an action to improve it based on the solution generated by the generative
model. In one step, the generative model only makes decision once because only one operation is
assigned in single time step, while the improvement model makes decisions for nttimes, where
ntis a hand-craft function related to the order of step t. Therefore, in one step, the improvement
model generates ntsolutions and we choose the one with the minmal makespan as the state for
next step. In this way, in a complete episode, for an instance with noperations, the generative
model generates Ng=ninteraction trajectories. The improvement model generates Niinteraction
trajectories, which Ni=Pn
t=0nt. We store these trajectories in their respective experience pools
for both models and use the DuelingDQN algorithm to train their parameters. In order to maintain
the stability of the convergence of the two model parameters during joint training, we only update
the parameters of one model while fixing the parameters of the other model in the same period.
Then, we alternate the parameter update behavior of the two models at fixed episode intervals. We
have shown the pseudocode for the training process in Algorithm 1 .

5 E XPERIMENT
To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework,we performed it on both FJSP instance of
random synthesis and publicly available FJSP benchmarks.
5.1 E XPERIMENTAL SETTINGS
Dataset: Similar to other related work, the model proposed in this paper is trained using randomly
synthesized FJSP instances. We generated 3 training instance sets of different sizes, each containing
100 randomly synthesized instances of the same size. In order to allow batch updating of neural
network parameters, all instances in each instance set in the training set have the same total number
of operations. In order to verify the generalization ability of the model, we also generated 7 test
instance sets of different sizes. In addition, we also used (ref1),(ref1), two well-known FJSP bench-
marks,which consist of several FJSP instances with different sizes. Hence, we can further verify the
generalization ability of the model by its performance on these datasets.
Configuration: In the optimal model that we trained, the number of GAT layers LO= 4 in
GAM O,while for other GAMs which L= 1. The embedding dimension de= 8 for all. For
all MLPs in the policy model, we set the hidden layer dimension to dh= 512 and the number of
hidden layers lh= 2. The maximum capacity of the experience pool in the DuelingDQN network
is set to 5000 , and the batch size sampled from the experience pool each time is equal to 1024. The
soft update parameter τ= 0.005for the Target Q networks, the discount factor γ= 0.99, and the
probability of selecting a random strategy δdecays from 0.5to0.2with a decay rate δd= 0.001.
(During inference, δ= 0). We use the Adam optimizer to update network parameters with a learning
rate of lr= 10−4. The maximum number of training episodes E= 200000 .The exchange interval
of two model parameter training K= 500 .
Baselines: For FJSP, a job sequence patching rule and a machine assignment dispatching rule are
needed to complete a schedule solution. There are hundreds of dispatching rules for the job-shop
scheduling problem and FJSP in literature with a wide range of performance. However, it is nearly
7Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2024
impossible to evaluate hundreds of dispatching rules. (ref) tested 36 rule combinations with 12 rules
for job sequencing and three rules for machine selection.We selected the four best performance
job sequencing rules and one machine assignment rules and combined them into four PDRs as the
baseline. Four job sequencing dispatching rules include FIFO(First in First Out), MOPNR(Most
Operation Number Remaining), LWKR(Least Work Remaining), MWKR(Most Work Remaining).
one machine assignment dispatching rules including SPT(Shortest Processing Time). We will use
these methods to compare the performance of our model with synthetic datasets and public datasets.
In addition to PDRs, we also selected two meta-heuristic methods [26; 27] and two DRL-based
methods [29; 30]. For the sake of data authenticity, we directly cited the best data from the articles
for comparison. Therefore, we can only compare our model with these methods on public datasets.
5.2 C OMPARISON EXPERIMENT
In the comparison experiment section, we will select the optimal model that we have trained and
compare it with other methods. This optimal model was obtained through a total of 100,000 episode
of training on synthetic datasets with scales of 5×3,10×5, and 10×10.
Performance on Random Instance We use the average objective value makespan, running times,
and Gap to the Gurobi Solver(A commercial-grade high-performance solver tool) to evaluate the
performance of various methods (including eight PDRs and our method) on synthetic test instances
of different scales, summarized in Table 1 . Through experimental data, we can clearly see that our
model performs better than other PDRs on instances of different sizes, while the computational time
is also in the same order of magnitude. Although the calculation time we spend will increase more
as the size of the instance increases, this is not enough to make us ignore the huge advantage of the
quality of the solution.

quality of solutions obtained by different methods. In addition to PDRs, we also directly cited data

from some related works for comparison with the performance of our model. Among them, [26; 27]
used meta-heuristic genetic algorithm and [29; 30] used DRL-based method. Table 2 shows the
experimental data we obtained on different public dataset. From the experimental data, it can be
seen that our method still surpasses all PDRs methods in terms of solution quality. Compared to
RGA and 2SGA, although our method did not outperform them in terms of solution quality, the
calculation time we spent was much less than that of these meta-heuristic methods. Compared to the
other two DRL-based methods, our model still has some advantages in terms of solution quality.
5.3 A BLATION EXPERIMENT
In order to further study the impact of the generative model and the improved model in the frame-
work proposed in this paper on the performance of the final method, we designed some ablation
experiments.
From the design of our framework, it can be seen that the generative model and the improved
model can run independently, which means that we can only use the generative model to generate
a complete solution or use the improved model individually to improve any feasible initial solution
generated by other methods (such as random generation or PDRs). Based on this perspective, we
compared the performance of different models on synthetic datasets. Table 3 shows the specific ex-
perimental data. According to experimental data it is obviously that using either of the two models
individually would result in a decrease in solution quality. Furthermore, for the improved model,
different initial solutions have a significant impact on the improvement effect. The result indicates
that our framework effectively improves the quality of the solution by alternating between these two
models.
Another question of interest to us is whether our model can improve its generalization performance
by receiving more training data. To validate this, we selected two models. One model was trained
only on a synthetic instance set of size 10×5, while the other model was trained on synthetic
instance sets of sizes 5×3and10×5. We evaluated the performance of these two models on test
sets of three different sizes: 5×3,10×5, and10×10. The experimental results are shown in Table

Job Shop Problem. We experimentally verified that our method can achieve good results. We also

user: What is the problem that the paper aims to address?
assistant: The paper aims to address the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), which is a well-known NP-hard problem in industrial manufacturing, particularly in the context of cloud manufacturing. The FJSP involves scheduling manufactured demands and manufacturing resources optimally so that all tasks can be completed in the shortest time while considering several constraints. Unlike the traditional Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), where operations can be processed on any machine, the FJSP requires operations to be processed on specific machine sets, adding complexity to the scheduling task. The paper proposes an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework to efficiently generate and refine solutions for this problem, aiming to improve both the solution quality and computational efficiency.
user: What are the claimed limitations in the state of the art that the paper addresses? Are the limitations real?
assistant: The paper identifies several limitations in the state-of-the-art methods for solving the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) and claims that its approach addresses these shortcomings. Here are the claimed limitations:

1. **Computational Time of Exact Methods**: Exact solution methods, such as mathematical programming and constraint programming, require substantial computational time, particularly for large instances, making them impractical for large-scale problems.

2. **Solution Quality vs. Time Trade-off in Heuristic Methods**: While heuristic and meta-heuristic methods like Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) and genetic algorithms provide faster solutions, the quality of these solutions may be compromised compared to exact methods. 

3. **Generalization Issues in Reinforcement Learning**: Previous deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches for FJSP struggle with scalability and adaptability, as the network structures used (e.g., MLPs and CNNs) limit the size of input problems. These models often need retraining to handle different problem sizes.

4. **Lack of Alternative Machine Selection in Traditional Scheduling**: Traditional scheduling methods do not consider dynamically assigning suitable machines to operations as effectively as might be possible with a more sophisticated model.

The paper claims that its proposed method, which combines graph neural networks with deep reinforcement learning, addresses these limitations by improving generalization capabilities and computational efficiency, while also maintaining or improving solution quality.

To assess whether these limitations are real:

- **Computational Time**: It's well-established in the literature that exact methods for NP-hard problems like FJSP can be computationally expensive, making this a valid limitation.
  
- **Heuristic Methods' Trade-off**: The trade-off between solution quality and computational time is a known issue with heuristic and meta-heuristic methods. This limitation is generally accepted in combinatorial optimization literature.

- **Generalization Issues in DRL**: Previous DRL approaches often do face challenges with scalability and generalization across different problem sizes, particularly when using networks not inherently suited for variable sizes, such as MLPs and CNNs.

- **Dynamic Machine Assignment**: The limitation concerning dynamic assignment of machines aligns with the complexity inherent in FJSP and differentiates it from simpler scheduling problems like JSSP, where such dynamic policies might be less critical.

Overall, these limitations appear to be legitimate concerns grounded in existing literature and the nature of the problem, making it reasonable that the paper focuses on addressing them. However, whether the proposed method effectively addresses these limitations would require a thorough evaluation of their experiments and results.
user: What is the key novel technical contribution in the paper? Is it really novel?
assistant: The key novel technical contribution of the paper is the proposed end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed to solve the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). The framework comprises two primary components:

1. **Generative Model**: This model generates scheduling solutions for unassigned operations. It uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent and extract features from the FJSP instances, which enables handling different scales of input instances.

2. **Improvement Model**: This model refines the scheduling solutions by adjusting the sequence and assignments of operations to improve the makespan.

A critical aspect of the framework is the concurrent training of both models, allowing each model to be cognizant of the other's policy and make informed decisions. This joint training approach is claimed to promote better integration and coordination between the solution generation and improvement processes.

Additionally, the paper emphasizes the strong generalization ability of their approach, asserting that it performs well on large-scale instances even when trained on smaller-scale ones.

Regarding the novelty of these contributions:

- **Generative and Improvement Models**: While using both generative and improvement models in a unified framework for scheduling is interesting, the idea of separate components for solution generation and refinement is not entirely without precedent in optimization and artificial intelligence. Hybrid approaches that combine different strategies are common.

- **Use of Graph Neural Networks**: Applying GNNs to FJSP is innovative in representing complex scheduling relationships and extracting features, but GNNs have been applied in various optimization contexts before, including some scheduling domains. 

- **Concurrent Training Paradigm**: The concurrent training of separate models to work together could be a novel integration if it demonstrates substantial empirical benefits that can't be easily achieved with existing methods. However, techniques that involve simultaneous learning of multiple components appear in other domains too, so the novelty would depend on the specific application and implementation in this context.

Without deeper details on the exact methodologies and a thorough survey of recent advances, it can be challenging to fully determine the absolute novelty. However, at first glance, the paper seems to propose a creative and potentially impactful approach, which appears to integrate components and techniques from different existing areas in a new way. More definitive assessments would rely on how these methods outperform or fill gaps left by current state-of-the-art methods in the scheduling literature.
user: Is the technical approach sound and clearly described? Are there any errors, unstated assumptions, or missing details?
assistant: Based on the provided excerpt, the paper introduces a comprehensive reinforcement learning framework to tackle the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). While it appears to present a coherent structure, there are several points to consider regarding the soundness and clarity of the technical approach:

1. **Clarity of Description**: The paper describes a dual-model framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) and reinforcement learning, aiming for generalization across different problem sizes. However, the actual implementation details, such as the specific architecture of the models and how they are integrated, may be lacking or unclear based on the summary. More detailed explanations of the decision-making process and the interaction between the generative and improvement models could be beneficial.

2. **Unstated Assumptions**: The paper assumes that graph neural networks can effectively encode the scheduling problem and that the learned policies can generalize across different scales. These are strong claims that need thorough empirical validation and exploration of conditions under which they hold. Additionally, assumptions regarding the computational complexity and scalability of the models should be stated more explicitly.

3. **Technical Soundness**: 
    - **MDP Formulation**: The formulation of the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) appears appropriate, but it is crucial to ensure that the state, action, transition, and reward functions are well-defined and lead to an optimal policy.
    - **Interaction Between Models**: The concurrent training strategy should be robust, avoiding interference or degradation in learning. It's not clear if there might be conflicts between the generative and improvement models' objectives or policies during training.
    - **Hyperparameters and Architecture Design**: The paper mentions specific models (e.g., GAT layers, embedding dimensions), but the process to determine these choices isn't described. The impact of these design decisions on performance and convergence might be significant.

4. **Potential Errors or Missing Details**:
    - **Training and Evaluation Protocols**: Details on the datasets used, the scope of hyperparameter tuning, and the baseline comparisons are significant for reproducibility and assessing the validity of results.
    - **Comparison to Baselines**: While the paper claims improvements over existing methods, details on the experimental setup, statistical significance of results, and whether the comparisons are fair (e.g., using state-of-the-art versions of baselines) are crucial.
    - **Generalization Claims**: The assertion that the method generalizes well across scales needs rigorous justification. It would be important to see how the framework performs under different scenarios, including edge cases.

5. **Ablation Studies**: While the paper claims to conduct ablation experiments, it is vital for these to be comprehensive to capture how each component of the framework contributes to overall performance. 

In summary, while the proposed approach is ambitious and incorporates modern techniques, a deeper dive into the full text would be required to ascertain the absence of critical errors and the completeness of the description. Researchers would benefit from additional clarity in the explanation of models, assumptions, training methodologies, and the robustness of experimental results to fully evaluate the soundness of the technical approach.
user: Does the empirical evaluation include appropriate baselines and comparisons to validate the proposed approach compared to the state of the art?
assistant: Based on the provided summary of the empirical evaluation, the paper includes a range of baseline comparisons to validate the proposed approach. Here's an analysis of how well these comparisons seem to reflect the state of the art:

1. **Baseline Methods**: The paper compares its approach against several baseline methods:
   - Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs), such as FIFO and SPT, which are well-known heuristic approaches.
   - Meta-heuristic methods, such as those based on genetic algorithms (RGA and 2SGA), which are popular for solving FJSP.
   - Two DRL-based approaches from recent literature, which reflect the current trend of applying machine learning to scheduling problems. 

2. **Public Benchmarks**: The evaluation includes experiments on public benchmarks, like those from Brandimarte and Hurink et al., which are widely used in the literature for FJSP research. This ensures that results are comparable with many other studies and adds credibility to the findings.

3. **Metrics for Evaluation**: The paper uses multiple metrics, including makespan and computational time, to evaluate performance. Makespan is a widely accepted objective in scheduling problems, and comparing computation time is essential to understand the trade-off between solution quality and efficiency.

4. **Generalization Claims**: There is an assertion that the method generalizes well from smaller to larger instances. Testing on both synthetically generated instances and public datasets of different sizes helps to substantiate this claim.

5. **Ablation Studies**: Some ablation experiments are described, which help verify the contribution of different components of the framework. These are useful for understanding the individual impact of the generative and improvement models.

However, some areas could potentially strengthen the evaluation:

- **Comparison Methodology**: While several baselines are included, it's crucial that the paper details the setup to ensure fair comparisons, such as ensuring all algorithms are well-tuned and run under similar conditions.

- **State-of-the-Art Techniques**: The paper does well to compare against heuristic, meta-heuristic, and previous DRL-based approaches, but further validation would include state-of-the-art exact methods (if computationally feasible for smaller instances) or newer hybrid machine learning techniques that might be emerging in the field.

- **Statistical Significance**: The presence (or lack) of statistical analysis on results, such as significance tests, would impact the robustness of the empirical claims. Demonstrating that improvements are statistically significant would strengthen the argument for the method's effectiveness.

Overall, while the evaluation seems comprehensive, the strength of its justification ultimately depends on the detailed descriptions and the rigor of the empirical methodologies used, which are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed approach against existing benchmarks.
user: Does the empirical evaluation report well-established and reasonable metrics?
assistant: Yes, based on the summary provided, the empirical evaluation in the paper reports metrics that are well-established and reasonable for the type of problem being addressed. The key metrics reported include:

1. **Makespan**: This is a measure of the total time required to complete all jobs in the scheduling problem. Makespan is a standard and widely used metric in scheduling literature, particularly for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and its variants like FJSP. It directly measures the primary objective for many scheduling tasks, which is to minimize the time taken to complete all operations.

2. **Computational Time**: This metric reports the time taken by each algorithm to find a solution. It is crucial for understanding the efficiency of the proposed method compared to others, especially when assessing the trade-off between solution quality (e.g., makespan) and computation time. Given that many scheduling solutions may have to be applied in time-sensitive operational contexts, this is a practical and relevant metric.

3. **Gap to Optimal or Baseline Solutions**: The percentage gap between the obtained solutions and a known optimal or baseline (such as solutions from commercial solvers like Gurobi) provides insight into how close the proposed method comes to the best-known solutions. This gap is particularly useful when dealing with NP-hard problems where finding the true optimal solution might be computationally infeasible for large instances.

These metrics are appropriate and align well with standard practices for evaluating scheduling algorithms. They allow for a clear and meaningful comparison between different methodologies, helping to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach in solving the FJSP. However, for a more detailed evaluation, additional metrics such as solution variance, robustness under different scenarios, or resource utilization metrics might be considered if they are relevant to specific application contexts. But overall, the ones chosen are satisfactorily informative for the core objectives of FJSP.
user: Are the evaluation benchmarks and datasets appropriately chosen? Are there any better benchmarks or datasets that should have been used?
assistant: From the summary of the paper, it appears that the evaluation benchmarks and datasets were chosen with the intent to cover a range of conditions typical for the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). Here’s an assessment of their appropriateness:

1. **Synthetic Datasets**: The use of randomly synthesized FJSP instances for training and initial evaluation is a standard approach in many combinatorial optimization studies. It enables the authors to control the complexity and size of the problem instances, facilitating a systematic analysis of how the model performs as problem size scales.

2. **Public Benchmarks**: The paper utilizes two well-known public benchmarks from the literature, such as those by Brandimarte and Hurink et al. These benchmarks are widely used in the FJSP research community, providing a common ground for comparison with previous work. They offer a mixture of challenges in terms of sizes and complexity, making them suitable for rigorous testing.

3. **Generalization Testing**: The model is evaluated on both scales it was trained on and scales it was not explicitly trained on, which is valuable for assessing the generalization ability of the approach.

While the chosen datasets are appropriate for benchmarking purposes in the context of FJSP, there are considerations and potential alternatives that could further strengthen the evaluation:

- **Additional Real-World Datasets**: If available, testing on real-world datasets from industry applications could provide insights into how the proposed method performs in practical scenarios. Real-world data often present additional complexities not captured by synthetic benchmarks.

- **Comparison to More Recent Benchmarks**: The field evolves, and while the paper uses established benchmarks, it could benefit from incorporating newer datasets if any have been developed since the publication of the traditionally used ones.

- **Diversity and Complexity**: Ensuring a wide diversity in terms of job types, machine capabilities, and dynamic constraints across all instances tested provides a more robust analysis of the framework's strengths and weaknesses.

- **Other Scheduling Variants**: While the focus is on FJSP, evaluating the approach's adaptability to closely related scheduling problems (e.g., dynamic job shop scheduling or flexible flow shop scheduling) might also provide further evidence of its versatility and robustness.

Overall, the benchmarks and datasets used are appropriate for initial validation and comparison to relevant prior work. To further solidify the impact of the proposed approach, additional datasets, particularly those reflecting real operational settings, could be integrated into future research.
user: Do the empirical results really support the claims of the paper?
assistant: Based on the summary of the empirical results provided, the paper appears to make several claims about the effectiveness of its end-to-end reinforcement learning framework for solving the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP). Here’s an analysis of whether the results support these claims:

1. **Performance Improvement Over Baselines**: The paper claims that its method outperforms baseline heuristics like Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) in terms of solution quality (measured by makespan) across various problem sizes. If the reported results consistently show a significant improvement in makespan compared to these baselines across different datasets, this would support the claim.

2. **Generalization Across Scales**: Another significant claim is the method's ability to generalize, maintaining strong performance on larger-scale instances even when trained on smaller ones. This would be supported by results showing that performance does not degrade significantly when applied to larger datasets that were not part of the training set, and that it remains competitive or superior to baseline methods.

3. **Efficiency in Computation Time**: The paper mentions improvements in computational efficiency. If the results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable or better solution quality within a similar or shorter computation time relative to other advanced methods like DRL-based approaches or meta-heuristics, this would underpin the efficiency claim.

4. **Ablation Studies**: The ablation studies are designed to evaluate the contribution of different components of the model. If removing certain components leads to a marked decrease in performance, this would support the claim about the framework's architecture contributing to its effectiveness.

While these results would generally support the claims made, there are several considerations to ensure the robustness of these conclusions:

- **Significance of Improvements**: It’s essential that the improvements noted are not only statistically significant but also practically significant. A small percentage improvement might not be crucial in all scenarios unless it translates to substantial operational benefits.

- **Statistical Analysis**: Claims would be stronger if statistical tests were performed to validate the significance of the differences in performance between the proposed method and the baselines.

- **Robustness Across Diverse Scenarios**: The framework should ideally be tested in a wide variety of scenarios to strengthen claims about generalizability and robustness. This includes various operational constraints and disturbance scenarios like machine breakdowns or urgent job insertions.

- **Computational Complexity**: While computation time is reported, an analysis of computational complexity could further support claims about scalability and efficiency.

Without additional details on the statistical robustness and comprehensive nature of evaluations, it's difficult to unequivocally state the full extent to which the results support all claims. However, based on the summary provided, there are indications that the empirical results align with the primary claims regarding improved performance and generalization capabilities.
